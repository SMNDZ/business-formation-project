## Introduction
New business creation is a strong signal of economic activity. Some periods see a surge in new businesses, while others slow down. This project explores publicly available data from the U.S. Census Bureau to better understand how business formation changes over time and across industries, and whether historical patterns can help estimate future activity.

The goal is not to create a perfect forecast, but to uncover meaningful trends that could support economic planning and decision-making.

## Business Questions
This analysis focuses on answering the following business-focused questions:

1. Which industries show the strongest signs of new business activity?
2. How does business formation change over time and across different regions?
3. Can historical business formation indicators help estimate future levels of entrepreneurial activity?
4. What insights can a simple predictive model provide for understanding overall trends?

These questions are intended to support policymakers, analysts, and business leaders in understanding where and when new businesses are emerging.

## Key Insights
Exploratory analysis shows that business formation activity varies widely. Most periods have relatively low activity, while certain times experience significant spikes. This suggests that external economic conditions play an important role in influencing when new businesses are formed.

A simple predictive model was used to estimate business formation values based on historical indicators. While the model explains only a portion of the overall variation, it is effective at capturing broad trends in the data rather than precise outcomes.

## Example Prediction
Using a realistic example from the dataset, the model produced an estimated business formation value of approximately **4,078**. This estimate should be interpreted as a directional indicator rather than an exact prediction, demonstrating how historical data can be used to support high-level trend analysis.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates how public economic data can be used to explore business formation trends and support data-informed decision-making. Although the model is intentionally simple, it highlights patterns across time, industries, and regions that can help stakeholders better understand entrepreneurial activity in the U.S.

Future work could incorporate additional economic indicators to improve accuracy and provide deeper insight into the factors that drive new business creation.
